# Lunch Location Randomizer - FE
## Problem Statement
Team members often face the challenge of collectively deciding on a lunch location. This process can be time-consuming and may lead to disagreements, especially when there are varying preferences within the team. To streamline this decision-making process, we have developed a Lunch Location Randomizer application.
## Technologies Used

## Description / Features
The Lunch Location Randomizer FE is a web application that allows a team to quickly and fairly select a lunch location. This application works together with a Spring-boot application that serves as the BE. Here's how it works:

- <b>Input Lunch Options:</b> One team member will input all the options each team member has. These options could be different restaurants or food places they'd like to consider for lunch.
    - <b>Displaying options input: </b> The application will also display options inputted by the team members.
    - <b>Removing options</b>: The application also allows removing of inputted options in case the team memebrs wanted to remove one of the options.

- <b>Randomize Selection:</b> Once all team members have agreeded on the lunch options and , the application randomly selects one of the options as the final lunch location. This eliminates the need for lengthy discussions and ensures a fair selection process.

- <b>Past Records</b>: The application keeps a record of past lunch choices, making it easy to track where the team has previously gone for lunch.
    - <b> Clearing all Past Record </b> : The application also allows clearing of all the past records.

## Room For Improvement / Future Features
There are many ways that this app can be improved upon! Here is a list of some ideas for future improvements:
- Adding location link for the final location
    - When click upon, would open google map to nearest location
- Allowing input across multiple devices
